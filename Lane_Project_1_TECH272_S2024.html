<h1>Carrington Lane</h1>
<p>I'm from Washington, D.C. and have lived there my whole life. When I was younger I lived across the street from a recreational center and would often play there with my friends from school. I used to take pottery classes at an art workshop on Capitol Hill and enjoyed working on the pottery wheel making cups and plates. For highschool I went to STEM specialized highschool where I learned graphic design, animation, and photoshop work in various digital media softwares.</p>
<p>As of right now, <strong>I'm a full time student</strong> at Montgomery College majoring in Computer Simulation and Gaming. I work at the movie theater and am trying to see all the movies nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars before they leave theaters. I also do volunteer at the Washington English Center tutoring English language learners. I'm also studying for the drivers test because while I do like the Metro sometimes getting on a crowded train or bus is tiring. </p>
<p>In 10 years, I hope to have graduated from a four-year college. I also hope to have moved to a different city in the U.S., working in the gaming field. I also hope to have a <em>better fluency in Mandarin Chinese</em> and have visted China, Taiwan, and Australia. I like pasta so I hope to have taken pasta making classes too. </p>
