            <p>Selick was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the son of Melanie and Charles H. Selick. He was raised in Rumson. Selick did little but draw from ages 3 to 12.

He graduated from Rumson&ndash;Fair Haven High School in <time datetime="1970">1970</time>. After studying science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and art at Syracuse University and Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London, Selick eventually enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) to study animation. He studied at the Program in Experimental Animation at California Institute of the Arts under the guidance of Jules Engel. His two student films there, Phases and Tube Tales, were nominated for Student Academy Awards.</p>

            <p>After his academic studies, he went to work for Walt Disney Studios as an &ldquo;in&ndash;betweener&rdquo; and animator trainee on such films as Pete&rsquo;s Dragon and The Small One. During his time at Disney, he met and worked around the likes of Rick Heinrichs, Jorgen Klubien, Brad Bird, John Musker, Dan Haskett, Sue and Bill Kroyer, Ed Gombert, Andy Gaskill, and Tim Burton. Burton served as producer on Selick&rsquo;s first two films as director, the Disney&ndash;produced The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. Years later, Selick claimed he learned a lot to improve his drawing, animation, and storytelling skills from Disney legend Eric Larson.</p>

            <h4>Coraline</h4>

            </figure>

            <p>Selick&rsquo;s first feature with Laika was Coraline, based on the novella Coraline by acclaimed fantasy author Neil Gaiman, and released in <time datetime="2009">2009</time>. It was the first ever stereoscopic 3D stop&ndash;motion animated film. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Coraline was nominated for Best Animated Feature as an Academy Award, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe.</p>

            <h4>Work with Pixar</h4>
            <p>Selick left Laika in <time datetime="2009">2009</time>. In <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, Selick joined with Pixar and The Walt Disney Company in a long&ndash;term contract to exclusively produce stop&ndash;motion films. This not only returned Selick to his original roots, but also reunited Selick with numerous former friends and co&ndash;animators. His new studio, called Cinderbiter Productions, was self&ndash;described as &ldquo;a new stop motion company whose mandate is to make great, scary films for young &lsquo;uns with a small, tight&ndash;knit crew who watch each other&rsquo;s backs.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Selick and Cinderbiter&rsquo;s first film under this deal, a project called ShadeMaker, was set to be released on <time datetime="2013-10-04">October 4, 2013</time>. In <time datetime="2011">2011</time>, the film was green&ndash;lit for production and retitled The Shadow King. In August <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, it was reported that, after spending a reported $50 million, Walt Disney Pictures canceled the project, due to &ldquo;a creative and scheduling standpoint, the pic wasn&rsquo;t where it needed to be to meet its planned release date.&rdquo; Selick now had the option to shop the project to another studio. Selick later revealed in interviews that the film suffered from interference from the then CCO of Pixar John Lasseter, who Selick claimed came in and constantly changed elements of the script and production that ended up ballooning the budget. In a <time datetime="2022">2022</time> interview, Selick said that he had reacquired the rights for The Shadow King from Disney and that he may revive the project. On <time datetime="2012-04-28">April 28, 2012</time>, it was announced that Disney had optioned the rights for Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s novel The Graveyard Book. Later that same day, it was announced that Selick would direct the film after work was completed on ShadeMaker. It was unknown if the adaptation would be live&ndash;action or stop motion. After the studio and Selick parted ways over scheduling and development, it was announced in January <time datetime="2013">2013</time> that Ron Howard would direct the film.</p>
